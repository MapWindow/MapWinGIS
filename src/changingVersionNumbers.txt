When releasing a new version version numbers need to be updated on several locations:
MapWinGIS.rc lines: 114, 115, 133, 139  						 [5.3.0.0]
MapWinGIS.cpp lines: 32, 33             						 [5.0]
MapWinGIS.idl line: 6742 (helpfile("MapWinGIS.chm"))                                     [5.3]
                  , 6764 (helpstring("Dispatch interface for Map Control"))              [5.3]
MapWinGIS.h lines: 13, 14                                                                [5.3]

If you want to update AxInterop.MapWinGIS.dll and Interop.MapWinGIS.dll
you can run the InteropCreator project. It is a C# project which will create the interop dlls for you.

Copy these two interop dll to the bin folder and you're ready to go.
